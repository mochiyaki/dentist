# medical-mcp

Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides comprehensive medical information by querying multiple authoritative medical APIs.

## 🚀 Overview

`medical-mcp` is a specialized MCP server designed to bridge the gap between LLMs and highly reliable medical databases. It provides structured, real-time access to critical healthcare information, including drug databases, medical literature, and global health statistics.

The server supports both **stdio** (for local CLI/IDE integration) and **HTTP** (for remote or web-based usage) transports.

## 🛠 Architecture

The server acts as an intermediary layer between the MCP client and various authoritative medical data sources.

## ⚙️ Key Features & Tools

The server exposes several powerful tools to the MCP client:

- **💊 Drug Information**:
  - `search-drugs`: Search FDA database for drug names/brands.
  - `get-drug-details`: Fetch deep specifics via NDC (National Drug Code).
  - `search-drug-nomenclature`: Standardized searches via RxNorm.
  - `search-pediatric-drugs`: FDA searches specifically filtered for pediatric labeling.
- **📚 Medical Literature**:
  - `search-medical-literature`: Query PubMed for research articles.
  - `get-article-details`: Retrieve detailed abstracts and metadata via PMID.
  - `search-google-scholar`: Access academic research via Google Scholar.
  - `search-medical-journals`: Focused searches in high-impact journals (NEJM, JAMA, etc.).
- **🌍 Global Health & Pediatrics**:
  - `get-health-statistics`: Access WHO Global Health Observatory data.
  - `get-child-health-statistics`: WHO indicators specifically for pediatric populations.
  - `search-pediatric-guidelines`: Access AAP (Bright Futures) and policy statements.
- **🔍 Multi-Database Search**:
  - `search-medical-databases`: An aggregate tool searching PubMed, Scholar, Cochrane, and ClinicalTrials.gov simultaneously.
- **📊 System Monitoring**:
  - `get-cache-stats`: Monitor server performance (hit rates, memory usage).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- npm

### Installation
